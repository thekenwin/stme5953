Amplicon (Amplification)
Piece of DNA or RNA that is the product of natural or artificial
amplification or replication events, especially during PCR

BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)
Computational biology and bioinformatics algorithm for comparing an input
sequence against a database to find regions of local similarity

Capillary gel electrophoresis
Method used to separate DNA fragments by size using an electric
field in a thin capillary tube filled with gel-like polymer

Celera Genomics (Craig Venter)
Private company co-founded by scientist Craig Venter that played a key role
in sequencing the human genome alongside the public Human Genome Project

Chromosome
DNA molecule with part or all of the
genetic material of an organism

Clustal Omega
Tool for performing multiple sequence alignments
of nucleic acid or protein sequences

CODIS (Combined DNA Index System)
Software platform used by the FBI to support criminal justice DNA databases,
helping match DNA profiles from crime scenes with known individuals

Conserved
Describes DNA, RNA, or protein sequences that have remained relatively unchanged
throughout evolution, indicating they have important biological functions

Distance matrix
Table that shows the evolutionary distance between
pairs of sequences based on their differences

DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid)
Molecule that carries genetic instructions used in the growth, development,
functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms

FASTA
Text-based format for representing nucleotide or protein sequences,
as well as the name of a sequence alignment tool

Genome
Complete set of DNA (including all
of its genes) in an organism

ggtree
R package that extends 'ggplot2' to visualize and annotate
phylogenetic trees using the grammar of graphics

Guide tree
Tree diagram that shows the relationship between sequences and
is used to guide multiple sequence alignment processes

Human Genome Project
International research initiative (1990–2003) that successfully
mapped and sequenced the entire human genome

Human reference genome
Digital DNA sequence assembled to represent the typical human
genome, used as a standard for comparing individual genomes

Locus (loci)
Specific, fixed position on a chromosome where a
particular gene or genetic marker is located

LDIS (Local DNA Index System)
DDNA database used at the local (usually city
or county) level in the CODIS system

Lymphocyte
Type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system,
including B-cells, T-cells, and natural killer cells

Multiple sequence alignment
Alignment of three or more biological sequences to identify regions of similarity
that may indicate functional, structural, or evolutionary relationships

NDIS (National DNA Index System)
National-level database within CODIS, managed by the FBI, that
allows for comparison of DNA profiles from across the country

NJplot
Software tool used to visualize phylogenetic trees, especially
those built using the Neighbor-Joining method

Pairwise alignment score
Numerical score representing the similarity
between two sequences after aligning them

PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)
Technique invented by Kary Mullis used to amplify small segments
of DNA, producing millions of copies in a short time

Phylogenetic tree
Diagram that shows evolutionary relationships among various biological species or sequences
based on similarities and differences in their genetic or physical characteristics

Phytohemagglutinin
Plant-derived compound used in laboratories to stimulate
cell division, particularly in lymphocytes

Primer
Short single-stranded DNA or RNA molecule that serves
as a starting point for DNA synthesis during PCR

SDIS (State DNA Index System)
State-level DNA database in CODIS, which collects and
stores DNA profiles from local jurisdictions

Sequence
Precise order of nucleotides in a DNA or RNA
molecule or of amino acids in a protein

STR (Short Tandem Repeat)
Repeating sequences of 2-6 base pairs of
DNA and are used in DNA profiling
